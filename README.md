# Python-DSA-Foundations

## Project Overview

This repository contains a series of Python exercises and notebooks organized into weekly themes. Each week addresses fundamental concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), building up from basic structures to advanced problem-solving techniques.

## Project Structure

### week-01 — Arrays & Python Basics
Introduction to arrays, binary representation, and foundational Python concepts.

### week-02 — Hashmaps, Sets & Recursion
Covers hashmaps, sets, recursion techniques, stacks, and queues.

### week-03 — Linked Lists
Implementation and operations of singly and doubly linked lists.

### week-04 — Binary Search & Trees
Exploration of binary search patterns, binary trees, and tree traversals.

### week-05 — Graphs & Heaps
Graph representations, BFS/DFS algorithms, heaps, and priority queues.

### week-06 — Problem-Solving Patterns
Core patterns for problem solving including two pointers, sliding window, and recursive backtracking.

### week-07 — Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming fundamentals: tabulation, memoization, and classical DP problem.
