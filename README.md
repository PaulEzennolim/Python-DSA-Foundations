# Python-DSA-Foundations

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python exercises, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks organized into weekly themes. Each week explores a major Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) topic, progressing from fundamental programming concepts to advanced problem-solving techniques.  
In addition to core DSA materials, the project includes mini-programs, data-analysis tools, image-processing scripts, dynamic animations, and machine-learning examples.
